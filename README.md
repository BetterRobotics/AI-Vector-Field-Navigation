# AI Vector Field Navigation - Instructions incomplete Will update within due time.


This script provides navigation to an autonomous system in just a few simple steps...

1) Increase "<b>attractor_field_strength</b>" until the robot can reach the goal.
      - this adjusts the heading angle and vector length

2) Put goal behind obstacle and increase "<b>rep_field_strength</b>" until the robot avoids obstacle.
      - remember to set the radius of the object "<b>rep_field_radius</b>", also, 
        at what distance the robot should start avoiding the obstacle "<b>rep_field_area)</b>"
